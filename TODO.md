# Peak Functional & Sports Medicine - Complete Site Overhaul

## Design Philosophy
Based on analysis of top-tier health content creators (Huberman Lab, Peter Attia's The Drive, Found My Fitness, Dr. Mark Hyman):

- **Medical credibility meets accessibility** - Professional but not clinical/cold
- **Action-oriented** - Every page should have a clear next step
- **Protocol-driven** - Tangible, downloadable, shareable content
- **Multi-platform hub** - YouTube, Spotify, Apple Podcasts integration
- **Email-first growth** - Newsletter is the primary conversion goal
